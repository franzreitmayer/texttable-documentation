## Motivation

Since the information technology industry left the aera of single programs the integration between different components became the heartbeat of any information systems. There are many different ways to implement such integration. And although there are many modern and spohisticated approaches to do that text files still play an important role in integration by data exchange.
TextTable is designed to support and analyze text files especially with plain fixed length file formats.
To do that TextTable allowes to create file definitions to parse and render the flat files and implements a simple selection and manipulation sql-like language.
