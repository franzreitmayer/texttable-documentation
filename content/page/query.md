## Query language Overview
The query language allows to select and modify the data at the parsed table with a sql like syntax. The major difference is there's no form clause, as there's only a single table available hence it doesn't make sense to have a from clause.

For details please look at the [Query Language railroad diagram](/page/TableQuery.rrd.html)
